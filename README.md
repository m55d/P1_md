# Toronto: 100 Dataset Analysis

- Data was scraped from the GitHub API by filtering users in Toronto with public repositories and gathering their profile information and activity metrics.
- An interesting finding was that despite a high number of followers, many developers in Toronto have only a few public repositories, indicating potential underutilization of their profiles.
- I recommend that developers in Toronto enhance their online presence by increasing contributions to public repositories,to improve visibility, community engagement and opportunities in the tech scene.
